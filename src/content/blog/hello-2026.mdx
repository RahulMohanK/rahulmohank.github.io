**Writing never occurred to me before, but this time it feels different.**<br /><br/>

Everyone has their own reason for wanting to start a blog - this is mine. At first, it feels simple: create a few HTML files, embed some beautiful images, write a catchy title, and fill the pages with real-life experiences.<br/><br/> 

Sounds easy, right ? But things get complicated once you actually try to build a blogging website. Which template should I use? What should I write about? 
Should I only share posts about new frameworks I experiment with, or should I write about everything that comes to mind - technical thoughts, random musings, or both? And then comes the toughest question of all: should there be a dark mode or not?<br /><br/>

I had been thinking about this for the past couple of years, but I never managed to turn the idea into something real. This time, however, I found answers to most of my questions. Well, Im still unsure about the dark mode part though (serious pun intended).<br/><br/>

I often ask myself why I waited this long to start writing. The truth is, 2025 turned out to be a particularly busy year. I had stringent deadlines at IBS and successfully delivered features for the pilot release that was planned for the project that I worked on. I also built **BrowseNest**, which started as an ad-hoc idea and slowly took shape.
In whatever time I could find between these things, I ended up reading a lot; about agents, LLMs, software architecture, and some non-fiction. I never had the habit of journaling what I read, but at some point I started doing it. Before I knew it, my Google Keep and Apple Notes were filled with thoughts and observations that felt worth sharing.
<br/>

**I am planning to use this space to spill my thoughts and create a playground for random ideas.**<br /><br/>

So here I am - grateful to 2025 for the realization and looking forward to a wonderful, busy 2026! <br/><br/>
